Ever built something at 3AM that made you whisper “yo…” out loud?

Yeah, that’s Q-Trader++.

It started with frustration, honestly. I was sick of backtesting in janky spreadsheets or half-baked Python notebooks where nothing worked unless I sacrificed a goat or restarted my kernel seventeen times. So I said screw it—I’ll build my own quant lab. One that doesn’t suck.

You open it up and bam—you’re staring at a clean Streamlit app. Not one of those Frankenstein dashboards either. It’s smooth. Snappy. It actually respects your time.

You pick a stock. Pick your dates. Pick a strategy—or better yet, make your own. SMA? Sure. RSI-SMA hybrid with weird threshold logic? Knock yourself out. Wanna throw in some LLM-generated madness? Yeah, it does that too. Like, you type “Give me a momentum strategy for tech stocks,” and it hands you back Python code. And not garbage code either—like, actually runnable stuff. Felt like cheating the first time I saw it work.

Oh and this part—chef’s kiss—you can compare strategies. Side-by-side. Apples to oranges to LSTM if you’re brave. It shows you all the numbers that actually matter: equity curve, returns, drawdown, Sharpe, win rate… all laid out like you’re about to pitch it to a hedge fund (except without wearing a tie or pretending you know Greek letters).

Backend? FastAPI. Quick. Clean. You can build on it. Frontend? Streamlit, but not boring. Whole thing’s modular so if you’re the type who likes to rip things apart and rebuild them better—this is your playground.

This isn’t one of those “made for the resume” projects. It’s personal. I bled into this. It’s for the dreamers and the overthinkers. The ones who can’t sleep because their trading idea might just work if they could test it right.

Anyway—download it. Run it. Break it. Or don’t.

But if you do… welcome to the rabbit hole.
